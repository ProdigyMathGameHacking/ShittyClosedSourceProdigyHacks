- Likely a couple (and most that have not been recently updated as part of the fixes), report to Issues and if it is in popular demand then I might try to fix it!

## FAQ

### Will it ever be open-source?

- Sure, if people want it, please report to Issues and like posts that request it to be open-source and I will consider it!

### Why isn't there any answer cheats?

- Because the math is very easy. Learn math!!

### I want you to make a CUSTOM cheat why are you so SLOW?

- Good point! But I don't really want to focus on making this, so, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+javascript">learn JavaScript!</a> It's good for you!!!

### WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK ON PRODIGY ENGLISH???

- Because this is for the Math version of Prodigy!

### WHERE WERE YOU THIS WHOLE TIME I HAD NO CHEATS FOR YEARS

- Did other people not make cheats (except that one guy who copied me verbatim, you know who you are)? Anyways, just check my <a href="https://github.com/rxzyx">GitHub profile</a> for other cool stuff!

### I REFRESHED AND THE MEMBERSHIP HACK DIDN'T WORK!!!

- That's because the hack is temporary, so for one session only. You have to run it again (formerly only in a battle, but now it should work outside one) every session.

### MAGIC COINS DOESN'T WORK!!!

- It sort of does (see below explanation). You can run the script when you're selecting the lobby or even when you are in the game (not the battle), then, do an action such as clicking the Membership icon and then go to a battle and it will prompt the necessary questions and work (level, pets and items works without going to a battle now).

### YEAH BUT MAGIC COINS REALLY DON'T WORK!!!!

- Seems like it only works for upgrading pets. Why? I'm sure the name that Prodigy calls it, "secure item," should give you an idea.

### PETS DO NOT WORK!

- It does. Refresh. If it still doesn't (it should), try executing the script outside of a battle, so when you are in the "world"

#### I am not responsible for your actions with these cheats.

## How To Use:

- Simply open the file that sounds more interesting, click the "Raw" button, then copy the code (or just click the copy button) and paste it into the Chrome console when you're on Prodigy.
- Alternitavely, you can try the javascript URL method (putting javascript:thecodehere in the URL box and clicking Enter), if that doesn't work it's likely due to JavaScript not being allowed in Chrome. To allow JavaScript in Google Chrome:
  - At the top right of the Chrome app, click the three dots and choose Settings.
  - In the left sidebar, click Privacy and security, then Site settings.
  - Under Content, select JavaScript.
  - Choose Sites can use JavaScript as the default behavior.
